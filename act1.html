    To describe myself would take more time than it would be worth reading this html file. My name plus the picture of that fried chicken should be enough to determine the type of

    This is the second part of a 2 part series that describes myself as an individual. I am who I am due to the actions of others around me. I am chaotic neutral and will keep being as such
